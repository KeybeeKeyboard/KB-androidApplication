Keybee Keyboard Android Application which is currently available in the Google Play store. We want to create the fastest, the most accurate and the most comfortable touchscreen keyboard in the World.

******************************************************************************************
Please note that the usability and design pillars of Keybee Keyboard layout are made to maximize the efficiency of typing and swiping with one finger. 
Before altering the layout use common sense and read the related patent documentation (WO2014111963A3 and EP2946267A2 - the patent has expired years ago and is not giving any commercial advantage to the developer) which can be recap with these three points:

1) Hexagonal key structure which means that each key is connected to SIX other keys. Not less. Not more.
2) The space key MUST be in the center of the Keybee Keyboard layout.
3) The most frequent bi-grams, tri-grams or n-grams are linked between the keys.

Here a list of necessary app improvements to reach the competitors.

Text algorithms:
- dictionaries in multiple languages (whit relative setting to enable them)
- auto suggestion based on the selected languages
- auto complete based on the selected languages

Typing algorithms:
- full swipe based on finger pattern (that's really difficult!)

Design:
- adding new themes
- adding new layouts
- develop the Keybee Keyboard theme configurator in-app (UX-UI needed)
- explore the possibility to remove the stored in-app images for the Keybee Keyboard themes
- possibility to move the keyboard around the screen

Other improvements:
- translation of the app in multiple languages
- update emoji Unicode list to the latest version (https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) based on Android version

Bug fixing:
- sticky pop-up for the special chars (not reproducible)
- search button sometimes is not working for some apps or websites
- 123 keyboard sometimes is not kept on numeric fields for some apps or websites
